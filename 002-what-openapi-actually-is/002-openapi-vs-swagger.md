## OpenAPI vs Swagger

### 1. Start with the confusion everyone has

Most people hear two names:

Swagger  
OpenAPI  

And naturally think:

- Are they different tools  
- Did one replace the other  
- Is Swagger old and OpenAPI new  
- Why do both names still exist  

This confusion comes from history and naming, not from two different technologies.

---

### 2. The short answer upfront

Swagger came first.

OpenAPI came later.

Today:

- OpenAPI is the specification  
- Swagger is a set of tools built around that specification  

Same ecosystem. Different roles.

---

### 3. What Swagger originally was

Swagger started as:

- A specification  
- A way to describe REST APIs  
- A tooling ecosystem  

In the early days:

- The spec was called the Swagger Specification  
- The tools were also called Swagger  

So everything was bundled under one name.

This is where the confusion began.

---

### 4. Why Swagger became so popular

Swagger solved a real pain early:

- APIs were undocumented  
- Docs were inconsistent  
- Integrations were painful  

Swagger introduced:

- Structured API descriptions  
- Interactive documentation  
- A shared contract idea  

It gained massive adoption across the industry.

---

### 5. The turning point in history

As Swagger became widely used, something important happened:

The specification outgrew a single company.

To make it:

- Vendor neutral  
- Community driven  
- Industry standard  

The specification was donated to the OpenAPI Initiative.

This is the key historical moment.

---

### 6. What OpenAPI actually is

After the donation:

- Swagger Specification was renamed  
- It became the OpenAPI Specification  

From that point:

- OpenAPI became the official standard name  
- The spec was no longer called Swagger  

So:

Swagger Specification → OpenAPI Specification

Same idea. New name. Neutral ownership.

---

### 7. What Swagger means today

Today, Swagger refers to tooling, not the spec.

Swagger now includes:

- Swagger UI  
- Swagger Editor  
- Swagger Codegen  

These tools:

- Use OpenAPI  
- Read OpenAPI files  
- Render OpenAPI specs  

Swagger builds tools around OpenAPI.

---

### 8. Clear separation of roles

This is the clean mental model:

OpenAPI:

- The specification  
- The contract format  
- The standard  

Swagger:

- Tools  
- UI  
- Editors  
- Generators  

One defines the rules.  
The other helps you work with those rules.

---

### 9. Why both names still exist

Both names exist because:

- Swagger tools were already extremely popular  
- Renaming tools would break the ecosystem  
- The brand had strong recognition  

So the industry kept:

- OpenAPI for the spec  
- Swagger for the tools  

This avoids breaking millions of existing users.

---

### 10. Common beginner misunderstanding

Incorrect belief:

Swagger and OpenAPI are competing things

Reality:

- Swagger uses OpenAPI  
- Swagger depends on OpenAPI  
- Swagger does not replace OpenAPI  

They are complementary, not competitors.

---

### 11. Timeline in simple terms

Early days:

- Swagger Specification  
- Swagger tools  

Transition:

- Spec donated to OpenAPI Initiative  
- Spec renamed to OpenAPI Specification  

Today:

- OpenAPI Specification is the standard  
- Swagger is a toolset built on top of it  

Same foundation. Clearer roles.

---

### 12. Final takeaway

OpenAPI is the specification that defines how APIs are described.

Swagger is a collection of tools that work with that specification.

Swagger is not replaced by OpenAPI.

Swagger is powered by OpenAPI.
